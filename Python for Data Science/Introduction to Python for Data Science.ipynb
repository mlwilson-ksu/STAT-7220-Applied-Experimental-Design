        "\n",

        "- For example, suppose I wanted to know if the mean annual income differs between undergraduate data science majors and psychology majors.\n",
        "\n",
        "- In this case, mean annual income serves as my quantitative dependent (or outcome) variable and major (data science or psychology) serves as my categorical independent (or predictor/explanatory) variable.\n",

        "- I as the researcher in this case don't have control over whether students are data science or psychology majors -- I'm simply observing a phenomenon.\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Independent Variable (Factor or Treatment Factor or Feature)**: We generally think of this as the $X$ variable that is being controlled at some level during any given experiment.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Lurking Variable (Background Variable)**: a variable that the experimenter is unaware of or cannot control which could have an effect on the outcome of the experiment.\n",
        "    - In the email example, annual income probably plays a role in annual spending. This isn't something the marketing department can control.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Dependent Variable (or Response or Outcome or Target)**: Usually denoted $Y$, this is the characteristic of the experimental unit that is measured after each experiment/run.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Effect**: The change in the response that is caused by a change in a factor/independent variable.\n",
